The Kids First Release Coordination brings different services in the Kids First ecosystem together to release data in a synchronized manner.

## Background
There are several services which drive end user apps in the Kids First ecosystem. These services all consume Kids First data and must stay in sync with one and other in terms of the state of their data. One service cannot have more up to date data then another service. Additionally, there may be other services outside of the Kids First ecosystem that are interested in staying in sync with the latest Kids First data as new releases get published.
Kids First Release Coordinator service ensures data consistency among Kids First data release consumers and is responsible for orchestrating the synchronization and publishing of a data release. Data synchronization is the process in which all data release consumers retrieve the latest release data and stage or store it in an environment/state where it is not yet accessible to the public. The publishing of a data release is the process of a data release consumer making the staged data accessible to the public.

## Coordinator and Task Services
The Kids First Release Coordinator Service consists of two types of services: The Coordinator Service and Task Services.

### Task Services
In order for a Kids First data release consumer to stay up to date with data releases, it must implement a Task Service. A task service should implement the endpoints in the Kids First Release Coordinator Task Service specification in order for the release coordinator to properly invoke tasks.

### Coordinator Service
The task service endpoints expose a common interface for the Coordinator Service to communicate with. Through these endpoints, the Coordinator Service instructs the task services to perform a sequence of operations that carry out the steps necessary for a data release to be published.

### Sequence of Operations
See the sequence diagram \<link here\> for a detailed specification of the interaction between the Coordinator Service and Task Services.
