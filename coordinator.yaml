  title: "Kids First Release Coordinator Service"
  description: |
    The Kids First Release Coordination brings different services in the Kids First ecosystem together to release data in a syncrhonized manner. It consists of two types of services: The Coordinator Service and Task Services.
      
    The coordinator service is responsible for issueing new releases and keeping tabs on progress between the different task services.
    The coordinator implements the spec outlined here so that users and task services may retrieve release information.
    
    ### Release and Task Stages
    
    Releases and tasks share a common lifecycle of states:
    
    - `pending` - The task is queued to begin
    - `running` - The task or release in in progress
    - `staged` - The task or release has compleded necessary processing
    - `publishing` - The task is making the release public
    - `published` - The task or release has completed or released successfully
    - `failed` - The task or release has failed do to some error
    - `canceled` - The task or release was canceled by a user
