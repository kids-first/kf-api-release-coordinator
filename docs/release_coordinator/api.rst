Release Coordinator API
=======================

The Release Coordinator exposes a Django REST API for interacting
programatically with users, services, and applications.

When running the coordinator locally, the Django REST Framework will be
available at the root url, http://localhost:5000 by default.
The live production api is also available at https://kf-release-coord.kidsfirstdrc.org.
